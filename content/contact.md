# I found a bug!

Please follow [our guide lines](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/Issue-reporting-guidelines) on reporting bugs.

# I have a question!

We have [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/discussions/). If, for some reason or other, you prefer a mailing list, use [the Git mailing list](mailto:git@vger.kernel.org). It is actually a Google Group which can be used as if it were a forum, too.

## But I really have only a quick question!

Ask away [on Discord](https://discord.gg/GRFVkzgxRd).

## But I would prefer to email somebody directly!

Please keep in mind that the time of competent Open Sourcerers is better spent on communicating publicly.
