There are several ways to participate in the Git for Windows project:

# Help users

On [the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/git-for-windows) or on [the issue tracker](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues), help is always welcome.

# Add documentation

A lot of documentation wants to be written, still. A good place is [the Git for Windows wiki](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki). Tutorials, step by step instructions and general background information, etc.

# Fix bugs or add features in the Git code itself

Download [the SDK](http://git-for-windows.github.io/#download-sdk) and build Git.

TODO: mention good practices to develop using Eclipse, MSVC, command-line, gdb, test suite (`set -x` and similar tricks)
