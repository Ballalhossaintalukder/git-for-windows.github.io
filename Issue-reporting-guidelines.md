* Search the existing [open](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/issues?q=is%3Aopen) and [closed](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/issues?q=is%3Aclosed) issues. Maybe the bug was already reported?
* Mention your terminal (if you use the terminal version), vim version, font used. Also terminal related things such as tmux/screen, $TERM, or similar things should be mentioned
* Describe your issue properly. If you spend 30 seconds throwing out a sloppy report, do expect that others will spend exactly the same amount on trying to resolve it.
* Include a [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) using GitHub Markdown's `codeblock` delimiters.
* Be prepared to test fixes!
* Be polite. You are asking highly competent software developers for help, for free, so you might want to avoid treating them as if they were a commodity or at your free disposal.
* For further inspiration, read reports that were resolved successfully, http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask and http://whathaveyoutried.com/.
