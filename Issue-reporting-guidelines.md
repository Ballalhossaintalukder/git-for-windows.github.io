* Search the existing [open](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues?q=is%3Aopen) and [closed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues?q=is%3Aclosed) issues. Maybe the bug was already reported?
* Include the output of git --version and the Windows version. In case the issue might depend on the server include its git version and Windows version also. Of course, if you use a 32-bit Windows or 32-bit Git on a 64-bit Windows, you really want to mention that, too.
* Mention what options you chose when installing Git for Windows, what console window you use (if any), anything that will make it easier to understand what exactly you tried.
* If your setup is different from "normal" setups in any way, it is a good idea to put specifics about that into your bug report, too.
* Describe your issue properly. If you spend 30 seconds throwing out a sloppy report, do expect that others will spend exactly the same amount on trying to resolve it. In contrast, if you write a complete and pleasantly informative bug report, you will almost certainly be rewarded by excellent help with your problem.
* Include a [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) using GitHub Markdown's `codeblock` delimiters.
* If your issue stems from a particular repository include its URL. If the repository is proprietary try to create a public test repository showing the same issue.
* Be prepared to test fixes!
* Be polite. You are asking highly competent software developers for help, for free, so you might want to avoid treating them as if they were a commodity or at your free disposal.
* An example for an outstanding report can be found [here](https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit/issues/206#issuecomment-44574988). You may want to imitate the level of detail.
