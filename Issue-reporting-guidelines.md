* Search the existing open and closed issues. Maybe the bug was already reported?
* Include the output of git --version and the Windows version. In case the issue might depend on the server include its git version and OS version also.
* Properly describe your issue. If you spend 30 seconds writing the report, do expect that others will spend exactly the same amount on trying to resolve it.
* Include a minimal working example using the codeblock delimiters from Github Markdown.
* If your issue stems from a particular repository include its URL. If the repository is proprietary try to create a public test repository showing the same issue.
* Be prepared to test fixes!
* Be polite. You are asking highly competent software developers for help, for free, so you might want to avoid treating them as if they were a commodity and at your free disposal.
* An example for an outstanding report can be found [https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit/issues/206#issuecomment-44574988 here]. You may want to imitate the level of detail and time and effort put into that report, to show your appreciation for the help you hope to receive.
* For further inspiration, read reports that were resolved successfully, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask and http://whathaveyoutried.com/.
