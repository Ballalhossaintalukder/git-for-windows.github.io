## What is the relationship between *Git for Windows* and *msysGit*?

*Git for Windows* used to be developed using the development environment called "msysGit", but roughly coinciding with Git 2.1, msysGit was superseded by a new development environment: the [Git for Windows SDK](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/releases).
