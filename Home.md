This is the Git for Windows wiki. It looks more technical than [our home page](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) because it is the place where you can contribute to the documentation about Git for Windows.

If you need inspiration what you could write about: document your common work flows. Write a tutorial how to start coding Git for Windows, how to run the test suite. Write a tutorial how to debug a failing test. Write about something you would have wished you had known about Git for Windows a long time ago.
